     <h2>Move</h2>
     <h3>S. Borek</h3>
     <p>
      Shattered<br />
      By a silence heard but never spoken of<br />
      In a fragile moment of mortality<br />
      On the verge of breaking down and falling out<br />
      You will find a refuge in the dark
    </p>

    <p>
      [CHORUS]<br />
      And we'll move<br />
      And we'll dance<br />
      And the ground beneath our feet will start to shake<br />
      As it tears<br />
      We will pay the price for a love not meant to be, yeah
    </p>

    <p>
      Grounded<br />
      By reality as it hits so fast you won't know<br />
      What to do when your number is up, the time is near<br />
      Won't you hold my hand when I start to slip and push comes to shove<br />
      It's going to hurt when we hit the wall
    </p>

    <p>
      [CHORUS]
    </p>

    <p>
      I'll be right there standing by your side<br />
      I'll be right there holding by your side<br />
      I'll be right there falling by your side
    </p>

    <h2>Synthetic Fantasy</h2>
    <h3>S. Borek</h3>
    <p>Dug you out of a rut in the road<br />
      Found you stumblin' on the ground<br />
      All wrapped up in self examination<br />
      A show of smoke and mirrors all around
    </p>

    <p>Living day to day, life can be so mild<br />
      It can bring you down, it can crack your mind<br />
      Won't you show a little mortality<br />
      And let your grip slip on reality?
    </p>

    <p>Just ease back in your seat, child<br />
      Close your eyes, tune out the voices deep inside<br />
      Don't hold your breath<br />
      Put away your fears<br />
      And let me drive
    </p>

    <p>[CHORUS]<br />
      Step on in and I'll help you live your<br />
      Synthetic Fantasy<br />
      Hide your dreams under lock and key in your<br />
      Synthetic Fantasy<br />
      No one will find you here<br />
      I'll keep you up all night in your<br />
      Synthetic Fantasy
    </p>

    <p>I don't know but I've been told<br />
      A little dreamin' never hurt a soul<br />
      Take a step back from those ruminations<br />
      I'm your electric fascination
    </p>

    <p>Your imagination's running wild<br />
      I'm gonna make you a spoiled child<br />
      Oh, tonight you look like sin<br />
      Come on, baby, now let me in
    </p>

    <p>[CHORUSx3]</p>

    <h2>Miss Chameleon</h2>
    <h3>S. Borek, K. Lindsay</h3>
    <p>
      Shattered glass<br />
      A dusty shelf<br />
      A lost reflection<br />
      No sense of self
    </p>

    <p>
      Runs away she can't stay she can't stand to notice<br />
      All the things that she hates she would change if she could<br />
      In the faux comes the fact she can't be<br />
      Anyone but someone else
    </p>

    <p>
      [CHORUS]<br />
      Hides herself as someone else<br />
      Changing colors like she changes her mind<br />
      An armored ruse to get her through<br />
      Another night another way to deny<br />
      She can't conceal the way she feels but she can tell you that she's fine<br />
      So Miss Chameleon, she hides
    </p>

    <p>
      Paints her face<br />
      A ragged doll<br />
      Up and up<br />
      She builds her wall
    </p>

    <p>
      Even she can't recall what it's like to be her<br />
      Empty shell, wears it well, think she likes to suffer<br />
      In the faux comes the fact she can't be<br />
      Anyone but someone else
    </p>

    <p>
      [CHORUS]
    </p>

    <p>
      When she's alone she feels the venom seeping in<br />
      Wishing she could change herself and shed her poison skin<br />
      But even though she's tried to like what she's betrayed<br />
      In the end she is to blame<br />
      She'll never change she wants to fade away<br />
      Fade away...
    </p>

    <h2>A Million Years</h2>
    <h3>S. Borek</h3>

    <p>Hello, old friend<br />
      It's so funny to see you again<br />
      I don't recall<br />
      Was it last year, before the fall?
    </p>

    <p>Come in, sit down<br />
      Won't you try to put on a smile?<br />
      Would it kill you to place a call?<br />
      It wouldn't have mattered
    </p>

    <p>But it's so sad, so far to fall<br />
      The lights dim down for curtain call<br />
      Was it worth the price of admission?<br />
      Can't break the code on this transmission
    </p>

    <p>I thought we had it all<br />
      Wrapped in velvet walls of our gilded halls<br />
      Deep inside a monster hides<br />
      But I'm so blind to its call
    </p>

    <p>Through the cracked fa√ßade<br />
      I see what lies ahead<br />
      It makes me live in pain and fear<br />
      So I'll just lay down and play dead
    </p>

    <p>Please don't pretend<br />
      Your untruths bleed upon the floor<br />
      Was it worth the price of admission?<br />
      Can't break the code on your transmission
    </p>

    <p>[CHORUS]<br />
      Do you recall?<br />
      The faded paintings in the hall<br />
      By the fire which burned so bright<br />
      Extinguished in the middle of the night<br />
      So dark it hid the candlelight<br />
      From a heart that shined sincere<br />
      We thought we'd last a million years
    </p>

    <p>Frozen in panes of glass<br />
      Our memories we once so tightly clasped<br />
      Now lay in pieces across the shore<br />
      Casualities of a brutal war<br />
    </p>

    <p>Your tail lights glow so softly<br />
      Steered by lies on down the highway<br />
      Never look back at what's left behind<br />
      The wrecks that burn, leave them behind
    </p>

    <p>So sad, so far to fall<br />
      The lights dim down for curtain call<br />
      Was it worth the price of admission?<br />
      Can't break the code on this transmission
    </p>

    <p>Looking back how the years passed by<br />
      You shake your head, and you ask 'why?'<br />
      Remember those dreams we used to fly<br />
      Was there too much static to hear me cry?
    </p>

    <p>Blow the dust off the picture frame<br />
      Am I ever going to see you again?<br />
      Not that face that's worn from tears of shame<br />
      The mirror says you're not the same
    </p>

    <p>[CHORUS]</p>

    <h2>Illusions of the Mind</h2>
    <h3>S. Borek</h3>

    <p>
      You're dancing<br />
      On a thin red line<br />
      You're flirting<br />
      With a mind that knows you all too well<br />
      Those little tricks and games you play<br />
      It's all about the here and now<br />
      I'll take it back my every word<br />
      Just give me back my peace of mind
    </p>

    <p>
      You stole when you picked the lock to my heart<br />
      Just a footnote in your history book<br />
      Don't give me another doe-eyed look
    </p>

    <p>
      [CHORUS]<br />
      Go on, get out<br />
      You got what you came here for (Illusions of the mind)<br />
      I've had all I can stand<br />
      The secret's out<br />
      No vault could contain (The stars in the sky)<br />
      Your plan sure was grand<br />
      Go on, get out<br />
      You got what you came here for (Looking out for number one)<br />
      Did you have enough fun?<br />
      Go on, get out<br />
      You got what you came here for (Illusions of the mind)<br />
      I've had all I can stand tonight
    </p>

    <p>
      Take a seat girl<br />
      Have another glass of that crimson wine<br />
      Just relax, girl<br />
      The hero in your story he turns out fine<br />
      He's part protagonist, antagonist<br />
      His heart is torn in two<br />
      As you sit and stare through your eyes of glass<br />
      Paralyzed by your web of lies
    </p>

    <p>
      [CHORUS]
    </p>

    <p>
      Deep in the shadows you'll find<br />
      Fragments of comfort and joy
    </p>

    <p>
      [CHORUS]
    </p>

    <h2>Something Golden</h2>
    <h3>S. Borek, K. Lindsay</h3>

    <p>Our backdrop is a field so gray<br />
      I never thought there'd come a day<br />
      That would make me want to run away<br />
      So far away
    </p>

    <p>And lonely is the chair so cold<br />
      And though I struggle against its hold<br />
      The vacant look within your eyes<br />
      Reflects your heart of stone
    </p>

    <p>[CHORUS]<br />
      Don't leave this, hold me up now<br />
      Pull me from these tides of sorrow<br />
      Keep me somewhere safe from harm<br />
      'Cause I can't breathe, no I can't sleep<br />
      Break apart and be set free<br />
      Something golden's happening
    </p>

    <p>In this war of bitterness<br />
      I've lost all sense of consequence<br />
      Such a pity, no remorse<br />
      I won't protest
    </p>

    <p>You put my back against the wall<br />
      The lighthouse flashed a warning sign<br />
      Illuminate the path ahead<br />
      I'll rest my weary head
    </p>

    <p>[CHORUS]</p>

    <p>I see the hourglass at hand<br />
      I sit and count the tiny grains of sand<br />
      Though each day feels so bland<br />
      I know I'll find<br />
      A better place, another land<br />
    </p>

    <p>[CHORUS]</p>

    <p>I know I'll find<br />
      A better place<br />
      Another land<br />
      Somewhere out there<br />
      A better place<br />
      Another land

    <h2>The Great Escape</h2>
    <h3>S. Borek</h3>

    <p>
      Round the corner, down the stairs<br />
      Heads tucked low, we're out the door<br />
      Don't look back there is no time<br />
      The heart won't listen to the mind
    </p>

    <p>
      Hurry now, we don't have long<br />
      Feels like we're moving at the speed of sound<br />
      The voice inside wants to know where you're taking me
    </p>

    <p>
      Lurking in the depths nearby<br />
      A shackled monster with a wicked prize<br />
      Be careful please don't take the bait<br />
      Just focus now, come on make haste!
    </p>

    <p>
      [CHORUS]<br />
      They call it the great escape<br />
      Riding on wheels made from fear<br />
      Running in a fatal race<br />
      They're hunted down
    </p>

    <p>
      Through streets run rivers formed from tears<br />
      Will they think to find us here?<br />
      Winding roads that lead us near<br />
      Challenges no soul can bear<br />
    </p>

    <p>
      This ordeal it's so obscene<br />
      No time to think the lights turn green<br />
      Pedal to the metal, won't you harden up your heart?<br />
    </p>

    <p>
      Run the reds there is no time<br />
      It's our best way out so we'll have to lie<br />
      No clear exits, nowhere to hide<br />
      You've unleashed the monster trapped inside
    </p>

    <p>
      [CHORUS]
    </p>

    <p>
      They call it the great escape<br />
      Running in a fatal race<br />
      They call it the great escape<br />
      Running in a fatal race<br />
      Running in a fatal race, they're hunted down
    </p>

    <h2>Confusion</h2>
    <h3>S. Borek</h3>

    <p>The day breaks as I slip through the fog<br />
      Retrieve my soul from the lost and found<br />
      Set out on a journey and I didn't look back<br />
      Now I'm comin' round, make some sense of it all
    </p>

    <p>I said goodbye, while you say hello<br />
      It's cold and it's lonely and there's fire below<br />
      But I'll be all right, kick back and relax<br />
      Close my eyes get taken for a ride
    </p>

    <p>[CHORUS]<br />
      It rains confusion as I look around<br />
      Swaying to the beat but we don't hear a sound<br />
      French 75s go down like wine<br />
      Take another sip you'll feel just fine<br />
      I can't help but be inclined<br />
      To take flight in this dream, don't know what I'll find<br />
      Down and low now, the beat gets slow<br />
      Basking in the rhythm of the afterglow
    </p>

    <p>Get me off the dance floor<br />
      No I can't take anymore<br />
      (Just one more song)<br />
      Can't fight that intuition, it's using my addiction
    </p>

    <p>To take advantage of me<br />
      And a situation gone too far<br />
      Pour me another liquid libation<br />
      Such a sweet, sad, sexy song
    </p>

    <p>[CHORUS]</p>

    <p>Take me back, in a time machine<br />
      Take me back, to the point<br />
      Where I said no<br />
      I'll take it all back tonight<br />
      Some things are better left unsaid
    </p>

    <p>[CHORUS]</p>

    <h2>Out of Time</h2>
    <h3>S. Borek, K. Lindsay</h3>

    <p>Hearts in different spaces from our minds that wander far<br />
      Down the highway we've rode upon countless times before<br />
      Driven by a force that no one could ever see<br />
      I looked away and the world began to turn
    </p>

    <p>Just embrace the change<br />
      Come on, now, embrace the change
    </p>

    <p>[CHORUS]<br />
      Sunset fades to twilight<br />
      Memories start to blur<br />
      Can't escape the hands of fate<br />
      You're running out of time<br />
      Moments in a photo capture words we never spoke<br />
      Then you'll find you're all alone and you've run out of time
    </p>

    <p>Just embrace the change</p>

    <p>The waves of time wash away the troubled past<br />
      Golden shores that shimmer with every twist and turn<br />
      That you never saw approaching without your crystal ball<br />
      I looked away and the world began to turn
    </p>

    <p>Just embrace the...</p>

    <p>[CHORUS]</p>

    <p>They say things will never change<br />
      They'll stay the same<br />
      Don't ever change<br />
      Just stay the same<br />
      Please stay the same
    </p>

    <p>Sunset slowly fads to twilight<br />
      Memories start to blur<br />
      Then you find you're all alone<br />
      And you've run out of<br />
      You've run out of<br />
      Time...
    </p>
